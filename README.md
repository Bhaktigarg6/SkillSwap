## 🙋‍♀️ About Me  

Hey there! I’m **Bhakti Garg**, a curious mind currently in my 3rd year of Computer Science at **Banasthali Vidyapith** 💡  
I love building things that *actually work* — especially web apps that connect people, solve real-world problems, or just look cool doing it 💻✨

I’m mostly in the **backend zone** (PHP + MySQL is my jam), but I’ve been exploring front-end magic and APIs too. Projects like **SkillSwap** are where I turn ideas into code.

🎯 Focused. Practical. Always learning.

Let’s connect and build something impactful:
